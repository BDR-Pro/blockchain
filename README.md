## How to Calculate TeraFLOPs Like a Gen Z Pro 🚀✨

Hey fam! Welcome to the ultra-cool, super chill guide on calculating those big brain numbers we call TeraFLOPs. If you're diving into the deep end of AI models or just wanna flex on your tech squad, you've come to the right place. Let's decode this like we're breaking into the mainframe of the future. 🌐💻

## What's a TeraFLOP, You Ask? 🤔💥

A TeraFLOP (that's 'floating-point operations per second', if you wanna get all dictionary about it) is like the horsepower of your AI ride. It tells you how many trillions of math problems your computer or model can solve every second. More TeraFLOPs? More power to you – literally. We're talking mega mind speeds, people!

## Getting the Deets (Details, obvi) 📊👀

Before you start, you'll need:

- Your model (this ain't no fashion show – we're talking neural networks, baby!)
- Some tools (TensorFlow, PyTorch, or whatever floats your computational boat)
- A vibe for adventure (mandatory, no exceptions)

### Step 1: Warm-Up 🏃‍♂️🔥

Get your model up and running. Make sure it's trained, loaded, and ready to show off its smarts. We're about to put it to the test!

### Step 2: The Magic Spell 🧙‍♂️✨

If you're using a tool like TensorFlow or something similar, there's usually a way to calculate those FLOPs. It might involve some code – don't panic! Copy-paste is your friend, and so is Google.

If you’re all about that Python life (and who isn’t?), here’s a little something you might use:

```python
# Python wizardry here
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.profiler.model_analyzer import profile
from tensorflow.python.profiler.option_builder import ProfileOptionBuilder

def estimate_model_teraflops(model):
  forward_pass = tf.function(model.call, input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec(shape=(1,) + model.input_shape[1:])])
  graph_info = profile(forward_pass.get_concrete_function().graph, options=ProfileOptionBuilder.float_operation())
  flops = graph_info.total_float_ops
  return flops  / 10**12

print(f"Your model is flexing with {estimate_model_teraflops(model)} TeraFLOPs!")
```

### Step 3: Flex 💪🌟

Got that number? That's how powerful your AI model is. Share it with friends, make your enemies jealous, and maybe even impress your cat with your big brain energy.

#### Example Output

```bash
Epoch 1/5
1875/1875 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 5s 2ms/step - accuracy: 0.8798 - loss: 0.4296
Epoch 2/5
1875/1875 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 3s 1ms/step - accuracy: 0.9657 - loss: 0.1165
Epoch 3/5
1875/1875 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 3s 1ms/step - accuracy: 0.9788 - loss: 0.0744
Epoch 4/5
1875/1875 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 4s 2ms/step - accuracy: 0.9839 - loss: 0.0540
Epoch 5/5
1875/1875 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 3s 1ms/step - accuracy: 0.9875 - loss: 0.0426
313/313 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 0s 940us/step - accuracy: 0.9743 - loss: 0.0904
Loss: 0.07741480320692062, Accuracy: 0.9783999919891357
teraFLOP: 2.03452e-07
```

## Pro Tips for True Techies 🎓🚀

- **Accuracy Over Speed**: Remember, more TeraFLOPs doesn't always mean smarter, just like more horsepower doesn't make you a better driver.
- **Stay Updated**: Tech moves fast. Keep your tools and knowledge fresh to stay on top of the game.
- **Community Is Key**: Stuck? Ask around. The internet is full of nerds (we say that lovingly) who live for this stuff.

## Conclusion: You're Now a TeraFLOP Titan 🏆✨

And that's a wrap! You've just leveled up in the tech game. Use your powers for good, keep learning, and always remember: in the world of AI, today's flex is tomorrow's old news. Stay curious, stay cool, and keep calculating those TeraFLOPs! 🌟💜

## 🛠 Installation Guide (The Gen Z Way)

We hate boring setups, so we made this as easy as ABC. But hey, before you jump in, make sure you've got OpenSSL coz we're all about that security life. 🔒

### 1. Getting OpenSSL (The Gatekeeper)

- **Windows Peeps**: Grab the installer from [this link](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html). Choose the version marked 'Light' cause we like to keep it breezy. Install it and **remember the path where you put it**; you're gonna need it.
  
- **Mac Users**: Chill, just open your terminal and hit `brew install openssl`. Homebrew's got your back.

- **Linux Gang**: You probably already have OpenSSL, but if not, `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev` (for Ubuntu) or the equivalent for your distro will sort you out.

### 2. Let's Get Rusty

Make sure you've got Rust installed. No? No worries:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Restart your terminal, and boom, you're in the Rust club.

### 3. Build and Run

Now, the moment of truth. Let's compile this masterpiece:

```bash
cargo build
```

And then, set the stage on fire with:

```bash
cargo run
```

### 4. install the required packages

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

### 5. OpenSSL Dance

If Rust starts asking where OpenSSL is at (like, "Hey, I need those secure vibes"), you tell it straight:

- **Windows**: Set `OPENSSL_DIR` environment variable to your OpenSSL path.
- **Unix-like (Mac/Linux)**: Usually chill, but if it gets fussy, export that `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` pointing to your OpenSSL lib directory.

## 🎉 Boom! You're Now a Rustacean-Crypto-Wizard!🧙🏼‍♂️🔮🎩🪄✨

Congrats! You've just set up **Alpha centuri**. Dive into the code, make some noise, and build something that'll make the blockchain jealous.

@cuda.jit
def matmul(A, B, C):
    row, col = cuda.grid(2)  # Get the 2D thread indices
    if row < C.shape[0] and col < C.shape[1]:
        tmp = 0.0
        for k in range(A.shape[1]):
            tmp += A[row, k] * B[k, col]
        C[row, col] = tmp

```

>**4** add requirements.ipynb to the project just run it to install the required packages

```bash

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

>**5** add ping.py to the project to check the connection between the server and the client

```python


async def test_ws():
    uri = "ws://localhost:8080"
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
        # Sending a "ping" message
        await websocket.send("ping")
        print("> ping")

        # Waiting for a response
        response = await websocket.recv()
        print(f"< {response}")


```

## Update **2**

![alt text](dns.png)

### "WebSquad connects nodes using WebSocket. Ping yourself, check Tor status, and sync with peers listed in 'dns.txt'. Dive into decentralized networking! #WebSquad"

#### "Connect and vibe with your digital tribe! 🌐 Our 'WebSquad' platform pings via WS, linking you to other cool WS clients. Stay synced, stay connected. #WebSquad #StayLinked"


1. **Start Server**: Initialize WebSocket server on port 8888.
2. **Receive Message**: Await "ping" message from connected clients.
3. **Read File**:
   - Open `dns.txt`.
   - Retrieve the last line (representing the latest DNS entry).
4. **Respond to Client**:
   - If received message is "ping", send back the last entry.
   - On error (e.g., file read error), send an error message.
5. **Loop**: Continue listening for new messages and clients.
